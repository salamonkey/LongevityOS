# Project Brief

Date: `2026-04-25`
Prepared by: `Product Manager`
Project: `Longevity Health OS (Health App MVP)`
Brief Approval Status: `approved`
## 1. Product Description

Preventive health navigation app that tells users what health action to take next, when to take it, and why it matters.

MVP centers on onboarding, generated health plan, prioritized dashboard, reminders, vaccination tracking, and family profile management.

Product operates as a guidance layer over user-entered data and is explicitly not a medical record.

## 2. Vision and Positioning

Position the product as a proactive health operating system focused on prevention, clarity, and execution.

Anchor the experience to the promise that users always know their next health step.

Present guidance as deterministic rule-based insight, not clinical advice and not AI.

## 3. Core Problem

Users do not know which preventive check-ups and actions are relevant to them.

Users miss health actions because reminders and priorities are fragmented.

Existing health tools store information but do not turn it into a clear next action.

## 4. Target Users

- Professionals aged 30–65 who want a fast view of relevant preventive actions.
- Parents who manage health tasks for multiple family members in one account.
- Health-conscious individuals who want structured follow-through on routine prevention.

## 5. MVP Objective

- Deliver a generated personal health plan and prioritized dashboard within 60 seconds of onboarding start.
- Turn age-and-gender onboarding input into clear preventive guidance with action, timing, and rationale.
- Enable users to track status, set reminders, and manage family preventive tasks from one account.

## 6. Core MVP Scope

### Onboarding and plan generation

- Capture age and gender for the first profile during onboarding.
- Offer a self-only or add-family choice during onboarding.
- Generate the initial health plan from deterministic age-and-gender rules at the end of onboarding, before the user lands on the prioritized dashboard.

### Dashboard and progress overview

- Show a prioritized dashboard grouped into Today, Soon, and Later.
- Display a read-only health score for the active profile as an at-a-glance indicator of how up to date the profile is.
- Let users open any prioritized item from the dashboard into detail view.

### Health plan and item detail

- List preventive health items with recommendation frequency and a unified status of Due, Planned, or Done.
- Show each item’s description, why it matters, and last-known status context on detail view.
- Let users mark a health item as Done from detail view.

### Reminders

- Let users set a reminder from a health item detail view.
- Offer reminder timings of 1 month, 3 months, or a custom date.
- Update the item and dashboard to reflect the saved reminder state.

### Vaccination tracking

- Show a per-profile vaccination list with status guidance.
- Allow users to add vaccination entries manually.
- Show the last vaccination date when an entry includes it.

### Family and settings

- Let a user create and switch between the primary profile and 1 additional family profile within one account.
- Show each profile’s health score and due-item summary in the family area.
- Provide a profile/settings area with two MVP functions only: view saved family profiles and turn reminder notifications on or off.

## 7. UX Principles and Tone

- Use clear, calm, trustworthy language across all core flows.
- Favor clarity over medical complexity in labels, explanations, and actions.
- Keep the experience mobile-first and focused on fast comprehension.
- Use lightly motivating microcopy that reinforces progress without pressure.

## 8. Primary User Journey

1. User starts onboarding and enters age and gender for the first profile.
2. User chooses self-only or adds family profiles under the same account.
3. System generates a personal health plan and lands the user on the dashboard.
4. User reviews Today, Soon, and Later priorities and opens an item for context.
5. User marks an item Done or sets a reminder with a preset or custom date.
6. User checks family profiles and vaccination status as needed from the same account.

## 9. Technical Direction

- Build a mobile-first responsive web app backed by 1 backend service and 1 primary database.
- Implement guidance with deterministic rule-based logic driven by profile inputs and item status.
- Keep MVP implementation modular, with clear separation between rules, application logic, and data access, and exclude external integrations from MVP.
- Use a unified domain model for profiles, health items, reminders, and vaccination entries.

## 10. Data and Privacy Constraints

- Collect only the minimum data needed for MVP guidance: age, gender, profile records, item status, reminder timing, and vaccination entries.
- Treat the product as a preventive navigator and not as a medical record repository.
- Encrypt stored profile and health-status data at rest and in transit, and restrict production access to named team accounts only.
- Use test data during development and testing.

## 11. Explicit Out of Scope (MVP)

- Doctor or provider integration.
- External API integrations.
- Real AI or AI-driven recommendations.
- Complex or advanced analytics.
- Insurance or ecosystem links.
- Automated vaccination import, verification, or document scanning.
- Medical record functionality or comprehensive clinical data storage.

## 12. Delivery Expectations

- Plan delivery within a 4–8 week MVP window.
- Sequence work as setup, core features, testing, and launch.
- Keep implementation limited to the evidenced MVP feature set and stated out-of-scope exclusions; do not add integrations or advanced analytics in MVP.
- Provide a clear costed scope before build starts.

## 13. Primary Success Criteria

- A new user reaches a generated health plan and prioritized dashboard within 60 seconds of tapping Start.
- 100% of completed onboardings with age and gender inputs produce a non-empty health plan.
- 100% of dashboard health items appear in exactly one priority group: Today, Soon, or Later.
- 100% of health item detail views show action, why it matters, and status context.
- A user can save a reminder with 1 month, 3 months, and custom date options for 100% of health items shown with a Reminder action.
- A user can add 1 additional family profile under one account and open both saved profiles’ overviews.
- A user can manually add a vaccination entry and see it in the vaccination list within the same session.
- Binary: the released MVP contains no provider integrations, no external APIs, no real AI, and no complex analytics.

## 14. Future Roadmap (Not MVP)

- AI-driven recommendations built on top of the rule-based foundation.
- Provider and doctor integrations.
- Advanced analytics and deeper progress reporting.
- Insurance and broader health ecosystem links.
- Expanded vaccination capabilities such as import or verification.
